# Fanta.css

A lightweight, fantasy themed stylesheet with basic styling for HTML elements.

You can use these for straightforward static websites or as a foundation to build upon with your own custom classes. This isn't a full CSS framework with layout grids, components or comprehensive utility classes. 

## Features

- No layout support
- Tidy CSS elements
- Lightweight & easy
- Light & dark modes

## Why I made this

I used the fantastic [HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) on MDN and modified it as needed.

I created FantaCSS because I ...

1. Design a lot of websites
2. Love fantasy themed stuff
3. Want to give everyone the theme

## Installation

### Manually

You can copy + paste the stylesheet into your project by grabbing [fanta.css](https://github.com/jamezmca/fantacss/blob/master/fanta.css) directly.

### Via CDN

Coming soon!

<!-- Drop this right into your `<head>` to use it via a CDN

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/boltcss/bolt.min.css" integrity="sha384-PSzHklU0wT897cBMg+9qlTsh9O0FtnWnfHus5/jGskSj518OHHoQug4Z2cAKCfcV">`

You will automatically receive updates/refinements as they are added.

If you want to lock to a specific version you can do so by adding a version to the href like so:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/boltcss@0.4.0/bolt.min.css">` -->
